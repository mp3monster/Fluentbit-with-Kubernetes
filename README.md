## About the Book
This book is all about Fluent Bit v2 onwards, focusing on its application and configuration. It's designed to cater to your specific interests in logging and monitoring, even if you haven't read Logging In Action.

It is being written as a partner title to [Logging In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/logging-in-action?a_aid=Phil) (although you don't need to have read [Logging in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/logging-in-action?a_aid=Phil)) to benefit from this book.
